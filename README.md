# Argus

Argus Panoptes, the all-seeing giant of Greek mythology, had a hundred eyes and missed nothing.

Argus is a Sodium-native Fabric and NeoForge client mod for OptiFine resource-pack compatibility on the modern Minecraft renderer path. No bridge mod, no wrapper layer, no old renderer detour: Argus implements the relevant resource-pack features directly where they render.

This is a stable beta. The core systems work in-game, most supported OptiFine pack features should work with existing packs, and compatibility bugs are being fixed against real-world packs as they show up.

Entity texture features are included for the OptiFine scope. Entity model and entity animation packs are not included; use EMF/ETF for that stack. When ETF is installed, Argus disables its overlapping entity texture features and greys out the related settings.

## Why One Mod?

OptiFine-style features share a lot of infrastructure: pack discovery, `.properties` parsing, condition matching, reload snapshots, atlas injection, renderer lookups, compatibility policy, and settings UI.

Argus keeps those shared parts in one clean-room implementation instead of duplicating them across several single-feature mods. That means fewer competing hooks, fewer duplicated caches, and one coherent Sodium-facing renderer path.

## Features

Implemented or actively usable:

- Connected Textures: CTM, compact CTM, horizontal, vertical, top, fixed, random, repeat, layered methods, overlays, and atlas tile injection.
- Built-in regular-glass CTM resource pack.
- Better Grass and Better Snow.
- Emissive textures for block and CTM textures.
- Custom Item Textures for `type=item`.
- Custom GUI textures for OptiFine-style container rules.
- Custom Animations MVP for block-atlas texture animation rules.
- Custom Colors and Colormaps.
- Custom Sky layers.
- Natural Textures via `optifine/natural.properties`.
- OptiFine-scope Entity Textures: random entities, random tile entities, paintings, chest/shulker hooks, layer synchronization, and emissive companions.
- Sodium settings integration for Argus features and visual controls.
- ETF compatibility: overlapping Argus entity texture features automatically stand down.
- EMF compatibility: Argus does not own entity models.
- Dynamic Lighting mod compatibility.

Not implemented:

- Entity model replacement and entity animation packs, including Fresh Animations-style CEM.
- Dynamic Lighting. Use a dedicated Dynamic Lighting mod alongside Argus.
- Vanilla terrain-renderer fallback.

## Status

Argus targets real OptiFine resource packs, not synthetic demos only. CTM, Better Grass, Emissive, Custom Colors, Custom Sky, Custom Animations, Custom GUI, CIT, and Entity Texture support have all reached visible in-game paths, but parity is still being tightened feature by feature.

Fabric/Sodium is the primary verified runtime today. NeoForge/Sodium now builds from the same shared client layer and is ready for runtime smoke testing.

The current terrain path is a correctness-oriented Sodium quad path. It is not claimed as a final Vulkan-native renderer implementation.

For detailed phase status, see `plan/roadmap.md`.

## Requirements

- Minecraft `26.3`
- Java 25
- Sodium
- Fabric Loader + Fabric API, or NeoForge

## Development & Contributing

Argus is developed against Fabric and NeoForge in parallel. Shared renderer or feature changes should build both loaders before they are considered ready.

Build and test:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :src:shared:test
.\gradlew.bat :src:fabric:build :src:neoforge:build
```

Run dev clients:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :src:fabric:runClient
.\gradlew.bat :src:neoforge:runClient
```

The Fabric jar is written to `src/fabric/build/libs/`; the NeoForge jar is written to `src/neoforge/build/libs/`.

Local Fabric test resource packs go into `src/fabric/run/resourcepacks/`. The NeoForge dev run can share the Fabric save folder through the dev-only `syncNeoForgeSavesWithFabric` task.

### Autopilot Benchmark

Argus includes a dev-only autopilot benchmark for comparing Fabric and NeoForge with the same resource packs and a freshly generated world. Each run deletes and recreates the dedicated `ArgusBenchmark` save with a stable seed, drives a deterministic movement/camera route, logs FPS plus renderer buckets, and closes the client after the final sample.

Example Fabric run:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat -Dargus.benchmark=true -Dargus.benchmark.autopilot=true -Dargus.benchmark.autopilotTicks=650 -Dargus.benchmark.seed=329562103 :src:fabric:runClient
```

Example NeoForge run:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat -Dargus.benchmark=true -Dargus.benchmark.autopilot=true -Dargus.benchmark.autopilotTicks=650 -Dargus.benchmark.seed=329562103 :src:neoforge:runClient
```

Useful options:

- `argus.benchmark.closeOnComplete=false`: keep the client open after the route.
- `argus.benchmark.closeDelayTicks=40`: delay before automatic shutdown.
- `argus.benchmark.world=<name>`: dedicated benchmark save folder to recreate; default `ArgusBenchmark`.
- `argus.benchmark.seed=<seed>`: fixed world seed; accepts numeric or text seeds. The current comparison seed is `329562103`, and it is also the dev benchmark default.

For fair loader comparisons, use the same seed and resource packs on both loaders and compare both logs, especially `sodium.ctm`, `ctm.resolve`, `ctm.prefilter`, `ctm.neighbor_view`, and FPS min/avg/max.

## Project Layout

- `src/shared`: loader-agnostic parsers, config, feature models, matching logic, and JVM tests.
- `src/client`: shared Minecraft/Sodium client runtime, Mixins, reload listeners, atlas injection, renderers, and settings UI.
- `src/fabric`: Fabric entrypoints, config path, reload/tick/builtin-pack bridges, and metadata.
- `src/neoforge`: NeoForge entrypoints, config path, reload/tick/builtin-pack bridges, and metadata.
- `plan/`: roadmap and implementation notes.

## Clean-Room Policy

Argus aims for OptiFine-visible resource-pack behavior without copying OptiFine code. OptiFine may be used only as behavioral reference. Do not copy or transliterate OptiFine implementation code, identifiers, class layouts, method bodies, or internal control flow into this repository.
